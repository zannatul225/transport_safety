If we see our recent state of supplying driving license it is visible that it is a lengthy process. It takes about 80-90 days to give licenses to the applicants. Moreover, the applicant also needs to face difficulties to get access to their license. We will develop a web application in which the applicants will get all these facilities online with an easy access.  

How are you solving?

The applicants will be able to apply online. After receiving the application, they will be provided with dates within which they will collect their learner license. After completing training, they will be provided the date to appear in the exam. After completing all the formalities, the applicant will obtain his driving license, which will be a Machine Readable (MR) smart card. This card can be scanned using a scanner machine which will be in the hands of the police officers. After scanning the card, all the information, including previous investigations record will be accessible for the officer.

Technologies we will be using:

1.	Driver and vehicle owners will be provided smart driving license and vehicle certification respectively.
2.	The data for both the driving license and the fitness certificate will be stored in a database accessible by authorized personnel.
3.	The driving license and the fitness certificate will be machine readable making it easy for the traffic police to verify the authenticity.
4.	Traffic police will be provided with smart card reader’s which will be able to display the driver information and vehicle fitness information respectively once the car is scanned.
5.	The online application system will be managed properly so that a driving license applicant won’t need to more than 14 working days for a properly documented driving license.
6.	Fitness certificate application will be sorted within 7 working days.
7.	As of now, we will be using Data management, IOT, OCR (optical character recognition) and databases.
